# Example: Open the current file in vscode and jump to the current position

## Windows/Mac/Linux
 - If you have the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor installed on your system (and the shell command available), you can easily jump between Obsidian and VSCode using the following SC command: `code --goto {{file_path:absolute}}:{{caret_position}}`
