# Example: Copy a link to current file to the clipboard

## Windows, Linux & Macintosh
Insert a link with file title and workspace name to clipboard. You can have workspaces named by e.g. book names that you read.
1. Shell command: `echo \[\[{{title}}\|{{title}}" -> "{{workspace}}\]\]`
2. [[Output channels|Set *Output channel* to *Clipboard*]].

This example works on all operating systems.
