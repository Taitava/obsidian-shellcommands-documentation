Hello, my friend!

The _Shell commands_ plugin is mostly developed by one person, me, with additional help from the Obsidian community in the form of feature ideas, pull requests, usage ideas, questions, and bug reports. Personally, I've spent over 1200 hours on this project since August 2021 (status of June 2023). I hope that the effort shows up in a way that makes this plugin useful and helpful to you, my friend.

I live in Finland, which is a country located in northern Europe. Finland is small by its 5.5 million population, but big by its area, and great by its heart. The Finnish society is built with great values, including democracy, social and economical equality, tolerance between different groups of people, stable politics, and the ability to live life freely. However, these values have not always been there for Finland. The history of my country includes [being involved in a civil war and the Second World War ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Finland), but our people has recovered from them, and built a strong, independent nation afterward.

The _Shell commands_ plugin is a hobby project for me, and I'm doing fine even by not getting any income from it. I'm doing this because I love doing it. As a citizen of a country that has a history of not so good times, my heart shatters for the fact that **there is a long-lasting war in Ukraine**, which is another European country. If you find this plugin so useful that you'd wish to donate some money for it, **please donate for the people of Ukraine**, so that they can recover and build a nation that will be equal, tolerant, stable, free, and most importantly: **Ukrainian** üá∫üá¶.

You can donate to any of the following organizations, or some other that you might have in mind.
- [Red Cross: Humanitarian crisis in Ukraine](https://www.icrc.org/en/donate/ukraine)
- [United Nations Crisis Relief: Ukraine Humanitarian Fund](https://crisisrelief.un.org/t/ukraine)
- [Unicef](https://www.unicef.org/ukraine/en/take-action)
- [European Commission: Helping Ukrainians](https://eu-solidarity-ukraine.ec.europa.eu/helping-ukrainians-how-you-can-donate-and-engage_en)
    - If you live in European Union, this page gives you a list of organisations via which you can donate in your country.

After donating, if you wish, you can come to say hi and tell that you have donated in the plugin's [Off-topic discussion section in GitHub](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/categories/offtopic) . This is absolutely voluntary, as is donating, too, and you don't need to tell the amount you donated.

‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you very much, my friend, for considering to donate! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Sincerely yours,

Jarkko Linnanvirta
