# Variable: `{{vault_path}}`

> Gives the Obsidian vault's absolute path from the root of the file system. This is the same that is used as a default working directory if you do not define one manually. If you define a working directory manually, this variable won't give you your manually defined directory, it always gives the vault's root directory.
