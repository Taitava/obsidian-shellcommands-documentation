# Autocomplete custom suggestions: Ubuntu Bash commands
## How it will look like
![[Autocomplete-Custom-Ubuntu-Bash-commands.png]]

## The list
Put the following content to your `autocomplete.yaml` file. [[Autocomplete#Create a custom autocompletion file|See instructions]].

**The list lacks some really basic Bash's built-in commands**, such as `cd` and `ls`. Maybe there's some problem in the script that generated the list.

## How the list is generated
You don't need to do this, but in case you want to know, here's how the list was made:
1. Create a new virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04, Bash 5.0.17.
2. Create the following Bash script file named `generate-autocomplete.sh`.
	```bash
	#!/bin/bash
	echo ""
	echo "\"Bash built-ins\":"
	for COMMAND in `compgen -b | sort | uniq`
	do
		apropos --long --exact $COMMAND 2>&1 | head -n 1
	done
	echo ""
	echo "\"Ubuntu commands\":"
	for COMMAND in `compgen -c | sort | uniq`
	do
		apropos --long --exact $COMMAND 2>&1 | head -n 1
	done
	echo ""
	echo "\"Bash keywords\":"
	for COMMAND in `compgen -k | sort | uniq`
	do
		apropos --long --exact $COMMAND 2>&1 | head -n 1
	done
	
	```
	The script fetches Bash built-in commands, external commands, and keywords, but it does not fetch aliases and functions, because I was not able to make them work in a script file, and I thought they are not so important.
3. Run command `/bin/bash generate-autocomplete.sh >> autocomplete.yaml `.
4. Open `autocomplete.yaml` in a text editor and do the following replacements:
	- Replace all double quotes `"` with `\"` - except in group names. It might be easier to first replace all double quotes, then revert them back in group names.
	- Do a regular expression replace with pattern `^(.*?)\s+\([\d\w]+\)\s+\-\s*(.*)$`. The replacement should be `  "$1": "$2"` (notice the two-space `  ` indentation in the replacement).
	- Do another regular expression replacement with pattern `^(.*?):\s+nothing appropriate.`. The replacement should be `  "$1": ""` (notice the two-space `  ` indentation in the replacement). The sentence means that no manual entries was found for certain commands, so their help text should be empty.
5. Comment out lines that start like `"["` (where the command is just a special character, e.g. `[`). There's no benefit for using autocomplete for them. This regex pattern can be used for it: `^\s{2}"[^\d\w"]+"`. Replacement: `  # $0`.
6. Remove duplicate commands in *Ubuntu commands* group. It's easier to do if you sort lines alphabetically within the group. Unfortunately there are some duplicates, I don't know why.
7. Sort all other groups alphabetically, too.
	
[More information about the `compgen` command on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/949006/2754026).

I haven't added, modified, or removed anything from the command names or help texts.
