# Variable: `{{selection}}`

> Gives the currently selected text.

## Availability
> [!Warning] Only available:
> In <em>Editing</em>/<em>Live preview</em> mode, <strong>not</strong> in <em>Reading</em> mode.

I'd like to make this variable available in *Reading* view too, but I don't know how. In case you are familiar with Obsidian API or know other plugins that are able to access the selected text in *Reading* view, [please let me know in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/issues/2).
