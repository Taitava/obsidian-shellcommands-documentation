#TODO:
- Reasons why escaping is important
- Different shells use slightly different escaping methods
- CMD does not use escaping at all :(
- How to prevent escaping by using `!`, e.g. `{{!file_name}}`
- The escape character (`\` or `` ` ``) is dependent on the current shell. Link to [[How to know which shell is used]].
- The escaping system is not developed by a shell expert, so it can have bugs and leaks. Safety cannot be 100% guaranteed.
