# Variable: `{{newline}}` or `{{newline:count}}`

> A literal linebreak specific to your operating system. Use an optional :count argument if you want more than one.

_(The above description can also be seen in the plugin's settings.)_

Windows: This variable does not work on [[CMD]], because CMD does not support escaping a newline character. Consider using [[PowerShell]] instead of CMD.
