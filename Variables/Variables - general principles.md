#TODO:
- Variable syntax `{{variable_name}}`, `{{variable_name:argument1:argument2}}` and `{{!variable_name}}` with a link to [[Escaping special characters in variable values]].
- Variables cannot be prevented from being parsed, e.g. there is no way to escape `{{` `}}` structures (except than to prevent writing an existing variable name between them).
