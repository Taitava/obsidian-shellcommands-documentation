> [!Info] About _custom shells_
> As there are only a few [[Shells#Built-in shells|built-in shells]] in the _Shell commands_ plugin (by default, the plugin only supports shells that come pre-installed with certain operating systems), _custom shells_ is a feature that allows defining shells in a more freely manner. Here is a non-exhaustive list of example shells that can be defined as _custom shells_:
> 
> | Shell | For macOS | For Linux | For Windows |
> | ------- | ---------------|-------------|--------------|
> | [[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)]]<br>Execute Linux shell commands on Windows. | - | - | Yes |
> | [[Windows - MinGW-w64\|MinGW-w64]]<br>Support the GCC compiler on Windows systems, but can be used to execute many other Linux commands, too. | - | - | Yes |
> | [[MacOS-Linux - Wine\|Wine]]<br>A compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications. | Yes | Yes | - |
> | BusyBox (no SC documentation yet)<br> From [busybox.net](https://busybox.net/): _"BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable."_ | Yes | Yes | Yes, through [frippery.org](https://frippery.org/busybox/index.html)
