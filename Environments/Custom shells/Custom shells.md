> [!Info] 
> As the list of [[Shells#Built-in shells|shells that are built in]] in the _Shell commands_ plugin is small (only contains shells that come pre-installed with certain operating systems), _custom shells_ is a feature that allows defining shells in a more freely manner. Here is a non-exhaustive list of example shells that can be defined as _custom shells_:
> 
> **For Windows:**
>  - [[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)]]: Execute Linux shell commands on Windows.
>  - [[Windows - MinGW-w64|MinGW-w64]]: Support the GCC compiler on Windows systems, but can be used to execute many other Linux commands, too.
> 
> **For Linux and macOS:**
>  - [[MacOS-Linux - Wine|Wine]]: A compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications. ^custom-shells-summary
