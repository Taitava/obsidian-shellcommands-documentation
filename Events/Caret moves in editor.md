# Whoops - this event doesn't work yet!

I accidentally released some draft code for the _Caret moved in editor_ event in `0.20.0`.  Enabling the event does nothing.

The documentation will be completed when the event is finally finished.

# Event: Caret moves in editor

## Execution
> [!Success] Executed when

## Variables

This event does not provide additional event specific variables, but all [[All variables#Normal variables|normal variables]] are available.

## Based on
The Obsidian event that powers this feature is [`EVENT NAME HERE` on `workspace` events](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/763a243b4ec295c9c460560e9b227c8f18d8199b/obsidian.d.ts). #TODO: Add event name and exact Obsidian API URL.
