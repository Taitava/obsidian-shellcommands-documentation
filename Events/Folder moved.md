# Event: Folder moved
## Execution
> [!Success] Executed when
> - A folder has been moved inside the Obsidian vault. The moving needs to be done by Obsidian, otherwise this event won't notice it (see below).
> - Also executed when a folder containing subfolders is moved (or renamed, which can be seen as moving a folder from one folder to another). The event is then executed as many times as how many folders were moved in total.

> [!Fail] Not executed when
> - A folder is located in `.obsidian` or any other folder starting with a dot `.`

## Variables

In addition to [[Variables - general principles#^normal-variables|normal variables]], the following variables are available during this event:

- [[{{event_folder_name}}]]
- [[{{event_folder_path}}]]
- [[{{event_old_folder_path}}]]

**Note:** Accessing these variables outside an event that supports them will trigger an error message and prevent executing the shell command.

## Examples
- [[]] #TODO: Add an example.

## Based on
The Obsidian event that powers this feature is [`rename` on `vault` events](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/blob/763a243b4ec295c9c460560e9b227c8f18d8199b/obsidian.d.ts#L3268). In Obsidian API, the `rename` event handles both renames and moves. The *Shell commands* plugin makes it more precise, and detects whether the folder has been moved or renamed, by checking if the folder name has changed or not. This is why SC's both [[Folder moved]] and [[Folder renamed]] events are based on the same Obsidian API event.
