# Output channel: Current file: top/bottom/caret position
Output will be inserted to the file that is currently open and active in Obsidian. If no file is active (e.g. you have Graph view active instead of a file), the output will be shown in a message balloon.
 
If *caret position* is used, then the output can replace text if you have something selected.
