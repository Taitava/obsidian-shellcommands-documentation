# Output channel: Ignore
Simply hides the output, doing nothing with it. This is the default for all commands' `stdout` output, because for many commands, the normal output is not so important. E.g. when creating a folder, launching an application or modifying a file - in these cases, the lack of error messages is usually enough to tell that the command executed successfully.
