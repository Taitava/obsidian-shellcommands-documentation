# Roadmap: The horizon of SC `1.0`

This page sums up some far-future goals of the *Shell commands* project. There are some fundamental features on my radar that I want to address here, because even though they are important, implementing them needs a lot of time, and often the presence of other planned features (= prerequisites). Some of the features are originating from other people's ideas, and I want to be more open about how I'm going to place them on the path of the future of this plugin.

The list of features is not explicit: new ideas may born along the way, and current ones may be refined.

> [!Info] Other places to look for incoming features
> - There is [an older roadmap in GitHub](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/projects/1), but I haven't really utilized it to its full potential, and it's also not quite the thing I'm looking for: I want a roadmap that shows a one glance overview of far-ahead cornerstone features without the noise of near-future small features. I'm currently considering to retire the roadmap in GitHub. 
> - For a complete list of all ideas/plans for features including both big and small, please see [this *Ideas* discussion section in GitHub](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/categories/ideas). In case you happen to have an idea, you can suggest it there ðŸ˜‰. Once ideas are implemented and released, they are moved to [*Ideas - done & released*](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/categories/ideas-done-released).

# Cornerstone features of SC `1.0`
These are not in any particular order, but some features are needed to be done before some other features can be done.
## [Migrations: Better support for complex, nested configuration properties](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/198)
 - A robust way is needed to upgrade old settings files to formats specified by newer versions of the *Shell commands* plugin. Version upgrades tend to bring changes to the format of the settings file constantly, there will never be a "final state".
 - A crucial prerequisite for importing/exporting shell commands, because the exporting format will be heavily based on the settings format.

## [Import / export shell commands (#151)](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/151)
- Allows users to share their shell commands with others easily by exporting them to a textual format that includes all settings related to the particular shell command.
- One user can share shell commands between their different vaults, or to different users.
- There will be a GitHub repository designated for sharing shell commands publicly with others, but shell commands could also be easily shared in Discord, forums or by other public or private means.

## [JavaScript API (#219)](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/219)
- The most basic level: support treating shell command output as JavaScript code that could be evaluated. Need to provide some basic public API, at least access to Obsidian's `app` (or maybe there's not need, as it [seems to be global nowadays](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-14-4-insider-build/35026)).
- Later: Define a public API that allows calling some of the *Shell commands* plugin's methods from user code (= either JavaScript that is received as output from shell commands, or JavaScript written in other community plugins).

## [Tighter integration with templater plugin.](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/217)
- Allow executing [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) scripts after a shell command is executed.

## [PowerShell: Handle output encoding](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/157)
 - Currently, [[PowerShell]] only works well when used with text that has only English characters - even if Unicode is used. Combine that to the fact that [[Escaping special characters in variable values#Escaping depends on the shell|there is not variable value escaping for CMD]], Windows as a platform is not currently as well supported by the *Shell commands* plugin, comparing to Linux and macOS.

## [Methods for variables (#147)](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/147)
 - A prerequisite for [#105](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/105).

## [Variables: Handling separator arguments without escaping (#105)](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/105)
 - I could add more variables that present listed content, but currently [[{{tags}}#Special characters in separator are escaped|there's no solid way to define item separators when joining list items together]]. [[{{tags}}]] is currently the only variable that provides a list of values, and I don't want to create more like it before I develop a proper way to define separators.

## [Support custom shells (#108)](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/108)
- E.g. [Git Bash (MINGW)](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/208) could be supported. Not everyone has it, so I'm not going to implement it as a permanent shell in the plugin.
- [Need to take exportability into account](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands/discussions/108#discussioncomment-3199601) - this needs planning.
